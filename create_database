--default database
	--mysql database is a system database that contains tables storing critical 	information about the MySQL server's operation.It includes tables for user accounts, privileges, roles, plugins, and other system-related data.
	--sys database is a set of objects (views, stored procedures, and functions) that help you interpret the data in the Performance Schema and Information Schema.It provides a more user-friendly way to monitor and troubleshoot MySQL performance.
	--information_schema database is a virtual database that provides metadata about the MySQL server and its databases, tables, columns, and more.It is used for querying information about the structure and configuration of the server.
	--performance_schema database is used to monitor and analyze the performance of the MySQL server.It provides detailed information about server events, such as queries, locks, and resource usage.
--create database
	--database name must be unique,no space
	--CHARACTER: (server, database, table, column)A character set is a set of symbols and encodings used to store and 		represent text data. Common character sets include:
		--ASCII: Basic English characters.
		--Latin1: Supports Western European languages.
		--UTF-8: A widely used character set that supports almost all languages and symbols.
		--UTF8MB4: An extension of UTF-8 that supports additional characters like emojis.
	--COLLATE :Collation defines how characters are compared and sorted in a 			database.
		--It determines:
			Whether comparisons are case-sensitive or case-insensitive.
			How accents and special characters are handled.
			The order in which characters are sorted.
			For UTF8MB4 Character Set
				utf8mb4_general_ci: Case-insensitive, general-purpose collation. ---> treats A and a as the same.
				utf8mb4_unicode_ci: Case-insensitive, supports Unicode sorting rules (more accurate for multilingual data).---->treats é and e as the same.
				utf8mb4_bin: Binary collation, case-sensitive.--->treats A and a as different & é and e as different.

			For Latin1 Character Set
				latin1_general_ci: Case-insensitive, general-purpose collation for Latin1.

				latin1_bin: Binary collation, case-sensitive.

	CREATE DATABASE mydb 
	[CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 ]
	[COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci];
--Show Database Definition
	SHOW CREATE DATABASE db_name;
--Selecting a Database
	USE database_name;
	or from terminal
	mysql -D dbname -h hostname -u username –p
--Viewing Databases
	SHOW DATABASES;
	or 
	SELECT DATABASE();
	--To Know which database is selected:
		SELECT DATABASE();

--Deleting a Database
	DROP DATABASE database_name;
	--drop datbase--->tables-->column-->data
--Modifying a Database
	ALTER DATABASE mydb
	CHARACTER SET utf8mb4
	COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
	
--Best Practices
	Use Descriptive Names: Choose meaningful names for databases.

	Backup Regularly: Always back up databases before making significant changes.

	Use Appropriate Character Sets: Choose character sets and collations that match your data requirements (e.g., utf8mb4 for full Unicode support).
